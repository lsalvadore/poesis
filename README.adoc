= Poesis

Poesis is a tool for upgrading ports on FreeBSD.

== Features

* Written in C++.
* Command-line interface.
* Upgrade ports by respecting dependency order: if port A depends on port B, then port B is upgraded first.
* Respect the automatic state of installed ports: if port A has been automatically installed, then port A will still be set as automatically installed after being upgraded; if port B has been set as explicitly installed, then port B will still be set as explicitly installed after being upgraded.

== Planned features

* Possibility to select which ports to upgrade (at the moment all outdated ports will be updated).
* Possibility to decide the update order.
